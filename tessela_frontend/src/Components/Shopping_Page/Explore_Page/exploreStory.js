Made from cotton and crafted on hardwood pedal looms, inabel showcases designs like binakul, pinilian, and ikat, each reflecting the artistry and heritage of Ilocano weavers."

        Ikat: {
            description: "Ikat (pronounced: Eâ€“cot) is a method for coloring fabric in patterns by resist dyeing. The pattern is not applied to the surface of a finished fabric, nor is it woven into the fabric structurally. Instead, parts of the yarns for the warp and/or weft are protected with a resist before dyeing. The dye then colors the yarn everywhere except under the binding. After dyeing, the bindings are removed and the pattern appears undyed on a colored ground. When dyeing is complete, the yarn is then woven into fabric, often in a relatively simple structure and at a density that highlights the warp."

            description: "Kalinga weaving, centered in Mabilong, Lubuagan, is a thriving tradition of backstrap loom weaving.
